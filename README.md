- Function:
 [mapping] = colorwheel(Magnitude_map, Angle_map)

          Input - Gmag: Magnitude map ( M x N Grid ). 
                    This grid give radial displacement to the color wheel.
                    
                - Gdir: Angle map (Grid size must be equal to "Magnitue map"). 
                    This grid give information of angular direction to the color wheel.
                
          Output - mapping: Mapped image which color is assigned corresponding 
                    to the magnitude and angle from the generated color wheel.
