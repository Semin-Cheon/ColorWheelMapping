Function:
        [mapping] = colorwheel(Magnitude_map, Angle_map)
        
Input - Gmag: Magnitude map ( M x N Grid ). This grid give
      radial displacement to the color wheel.
      - Gdir: Angle map (Grid size must be equal to "Magnitue map").
      This grid give information of angular direction to the color wheel.

Output - mapping: Mapped image which color is assigned corresponding to
the magnitude and angle from the generated color wheel.

â€» For th color wheel, i use a matlab code from:
